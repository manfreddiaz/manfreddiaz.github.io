I am a final year PhD student in Machine Learning and Robotics at [Mila](http://mila.quebec/) under the supervision of [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca) with focus on curriculum and generalization in reinforcement learning. I have interned at [J.P. Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence), [Motional Inc.](https://motional.com), and [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/technology-insights/industry-insights/technology/ai).

Earlier, I graduated from Concordia University with an M.Sc. in Computer Science under [Thomas Fevens](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~fevens/). Simultaneously, I spent a year as a visiting researcher in the [Shared Reality Lab](https://srl.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University under the supervision of Jeremy Cooperstock. Before, I completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science with _summa cum laude_ from Universidad de las Ciencias Informaticas in Havana, Cuba.
