I am a final year PhD candidate in Machine Learning and Robotics at [Mila](http://mila.quebec/) under the supervision of [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca). My research focuses on AI and ML roots within other scientific disciplines, such as economics, game theory, mechanism design, and social choice theory, how various problems at the foundations of ML mirror others in these disciplines, and how these connections offer well-grounded frameworks for better understanding the present and shaping the future of AI. 

In the past, I have interned at [Google X](https://x.company), [J.P. Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence), [Motional Inc.](https://motional.com), and [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab Canada](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home).

Earlier, I graduated from Concordia University with an M.Sc. in Computer Science under [Thomas Fevens](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~fevens/) while simultaneously acting as visiting researcher in the [Shared Reality Lab](https://srl.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University under the supervision of Jeremy Cooperstock. Before, I completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science _summa cum laude_ from Universidad de las Ciencias Informaticas in Havana, Cuba and spent close to 10 years working as a software engineer and architect developing distributed systems with .NET Framework, Java and C++.
