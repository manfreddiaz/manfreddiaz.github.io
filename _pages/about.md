I am a final year PhD candidate in Machine Learning and Robotics at [Mila](http://mila.quebec/) under the supervision of [Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca) with 
a keen interest in AI and machine learning (ML) shared roots with other scientific disciplines exploring human-built structures and interactions, such as economics, game theory, mechanism design, and social choice theory. Primarily, my research focuses on how various problems at the foundations of ML mirror those in these other disciplines and how these connections offer well-grounded frameworks for better understanding the present and shaping the future of AI. I have interned at [Google X](https://x.company), [J.P. Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence), [Motional Inc.](https://motional.com), and [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab Canada](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home).

Earlier, I graduated from Concordia University with an M.Sc. in Computer Science under [Thomas Fevens](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~fevens/). Simultaneously, I spent a year as a visiting researcher in the [Shared Reality Lab](https://srl.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University under the supervision of Jeremy Cooperstock. Before, I completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science _summa cum laude_ from Universidad de las Ciencias Informaticas in Havana, Cuba.
